1. Problem Definition

Find the shortest path for a robot in a grid from a start cell to a goal cell avoiding obstacles, using A\* search.

2. Assumptions

Grid size: 30Ã—30
Obstacles placed randomly (25% probability)
4-directional movement (up, down, left, right)
Start and goal always reachable

3. Performance Graphs
   Bar charts comparing nodes expanded and runtime are automatically generated.
